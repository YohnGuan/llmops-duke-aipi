# Rubric for LLMOPs class

This document outlines the rubric used for this class.

## Ten weekly demos

Look at the requirements for the final individual project and create a week by
week schedule for the next 10 weeks with specific milestones.

For each week, create a weekly demo. You will create a screen recording of at
least 30 seconds where you will talk about the progress made that week.

Watch the included lessons and make sure you cover the "Weekly demo delivery" question in addition to the progress on your project.

* Initial Post (50%)
    * Accurately describes the week's progress on the project with a screen
      recording
* Followup Post (50%)
    * Responds to two other student posts and demonstrates judgement

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not build the model yourself. Use the
> [Llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile) project as
> a reference.

## Final project delivery

You will deliver a project based on Large Language Models. For this class, you
will use a Local Large Language Model application. These are the requirements
for the project:

1. Has to be very well documented with a `README.md` that explains what the main
   purpose of the application is, how to set it up, and run it.
1. The documentation needs to have workable examples of the application.
1. It needs to have tests
1. The project should have automation with GitHub Actions that can produce
   a working container image. The resulting image should not include the LLM.
